    "We now demonstrate how to fit multiple models, each with their own response, to the same dataset. There are several reasons why this may be useful, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We are using data from a coded aperture mask. If there are multiple sources in the field they will all contribute to the spectrum from each detector. However, each source may have a different response due to its position.\n",
    "    We are observing an extended source using a telescope whose PSF is large enough that the signal from different regions are mixed together. In this case we will want to analyze spectra from all regions of the source simultaneously with each spectrum having a contribution from the model in other regions.\n",
    "    We wish to model the background spectrum that includes a particle component. The particle background will have a different response from the X-ray background because the particles come from all directions, not just down the telescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate the third example here. Suppose we have a model for the background spectrum that requires a different response to that for the source spectrum. The spectra and corresponding response matrices were obtained from the HEASARC and are available from https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/walkthrough.tar.gz\n",

This is likely to be the case for a standard imaging data where the response will only depend on the extraction region. Note that for a coded-aperture mask the situation may be more complicated with a different response for the source and the background even if they are extracted from the same region of the detector. We now define the background model to be used. In this case take the simple example of a single power-law "
