# PyXspec-Jupyter-notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebooks illustrating PyXspec analysis

The PyXspecWalkthroughN notebooks are for the examples in the Walks through XSPEC section of the manual. Those whose names include Matplotlib use matplotlib to do the plotting while the others use the native XSPEC plotting using the pgplot svg driver.
