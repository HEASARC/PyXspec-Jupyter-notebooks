    "```\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "       # Only 4 spectra are currently loaded\n",
    "        s = xspec.AllData(5)\n",
    "   except Exception, msg:\n",
    "        print msg      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which will print the error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Error: Spectrum index number is out of range: 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "PyXspec raises errors in a variety of situations, such as for invalid input argument syntax, or for input which is invalid within the context of the call (as in the example above). It can also raise exceptions if you try to rebind a class attribute when such modification is not permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Attributes To PyXspec Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly novel feature of Python (in comparison with say C++) is that it allows you to create new attributes \"on the fly\". The attributes don't have to have been part of the original class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " class C:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " x = C()\n",
    "x.pi = 3.1416\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of course is that spelling or case sensitive errors become much harder to detect. For example, with PyXspec's Plot object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Plot.yLog = True # Correct\n",
    "Plot.ylog = True # Wrong!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, standard Python will simply add a new attribute named \"ylog\" to Plot, and this will have no effect on the actual plot since PyXspec is only looking at \"yLog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So operating under the assumption that this downside outweighs the benefits, we've decided to disable the ability to add new attributes to PyXspec class objects. A misspelling or case error will instead raise an Exception object. And since some users may genuinely wish to add their own attributes to PyXspec classes, this default behavior may be overridden by toggling the Xset.allowNewAttributes flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "s = Spectrum(\"dataFile.pha\")\n",
    "s.myNewIndex = 10 # Error: Will raise an exception\n",
    "Xset.allowNewAttributes = True\n",
    "s.myNewIndex = 10 # OK\n",
    ".\n",
    ". # Can add new attributes to any PyXspec object,\n",
    ". # but attribute spelling errors will go undetected.\n",
    ".\n",
    "Xset.allowNewAttributes = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using With Other Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary benefits of PyXspec is that it makes it much easier to use XSPEC data and results in 3rd party packages. For example you can bypass XSPEC's built-in plotting functions in favor of a Python plotting library such as Matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/python\n",
    "\n",
    "from xspec import *\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# PyXspec operations:\n",
    "s = Spectrum(\"file1.pha\")\n",
    "m = Model(\"wa*po\")\n",
    "Fit.perform()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot using Matplotlib:\n",
    "plt.plot(s.noticed, s.values, 'ro', s.noticed, m.folded(1))\n",
    "plt.xlabel('channels')\n",
    "plt.ylabel('counts/cm^2/sec/chan')\n",
    "plt.savefig('myplot')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code produces a Matplotlib plot of the spectral data and folded model vs. channels (similar to what you get with Standard XSPEC's \"plot data\" command). It makes use of the Spectrum object's noticed attribute to pass a list of the channel numbers, and the values attribute (a tuple) to pass the spectral data values in counts/cm^2/s. The folded model values are obtained as a list by calling the Model object's folded method with a spectrum number argument."
